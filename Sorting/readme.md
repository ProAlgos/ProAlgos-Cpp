# Sorting Algorithms
Sorting Algorithms are one among the important algortihms because of the fact that it could reduce the complexity of the requiered operations after the processing to very effective. The simple example being searching. for an unordered list the time complextity of the most effective algoritm would be of the order O(n). While after sorting the complexity could be reduced to the order of $$O(log_{2}n)$$. Sorting refers to arranging data $$a_1 , a_2, a_3, ...., a_i ,..... a_n$$ such that for every indexing parameter $$i \geq j $$ , a_i > a_j $$. Most common ordering is based on lexicographical ordeer or numerical order.
Below is the list of variuos sorting algorithms :
* Bubble Sort
* Counting Sort
* Heap Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Selection Sort
* Shell Sort
