# Contributing Guidelines

## General guidelines
- When contributing to this repository, please first inform or discuss the change(s) you wish to make via an issue. This helps in letting others know what you're working on.

- For each algorithm, mention its **time complexity** and **space complexity** in the _"description comment"_ of its implementation.

    The format for the _"description comment"_ (which is written at the beginning) should be:
    ```
    <Name of algorithm>
    -------------------
    <Brief description>

    Time complexity
    ---------------
    O(...), where <description of variable(s)>    

    Space complexity
    ----------------
    O(...), where <description of variable(s)>
    ```

- Before submitting or updating a pull request, make sure that your code runs without any errors or warnings.
