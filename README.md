# Algos
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/faheel/Algos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/faheel/Algos)

Implementation of well-known (and some rare) algorithms, mostly in C++.

## Contents
For algorithms and data structures in C++, check out the list [here](C++).

## My goal
> Add atleast 1 algorithm to the repo every week.

### Want to contribute to open-source and help me achieve the goal?
1. **Fork** the repo :fork_and_knife: (and don't forget to star!)
2. **Add your implementation** of an algorithm that is not already in the repo (preferably in C++, but other languages will be just fine)
3. Submit a **pull request**.

Please read the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on the process for submitting pull requests.

#### Want to suggest some algorithms to add?
Just [create a new issue](https://github.com/faheel/algos/issues/new "Create a new issue") and I'll handle it from there :smile:
