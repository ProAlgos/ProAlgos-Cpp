Implementation of well-known (and some rare) algorithms, mostly in C++.

## Contents

For algorithms and data structures in C++, check out the list [here](C++).

## My goal

> Add at least 1 algorithm to the repo every week.

### Want to contribute to open-source and help me achieve the goal?

1. Read the [**contribution guidelines**][contrib-guide]
2. **Fork** the repo
3. Create a **branch** and **add your implementation** of an algorithm (or
   data structure) that is not already in the repo
4. Add **unit tests** for the code you've added
5. Submit a **pull request**

You can find more details regarding the steps above in the [contribution
guidelines][contrib-guide], so be sure to check them out.

### Want to suggest some algorithms to add?

Just [create a new issue](https://github.com/faheel/Algos/issues/new) and I'll
handle it from there :smile:
