Implementing well-known (and some rare) **algorithms and data structures**, while following **good software engineering practices** such as writing well-documented code, adhering to code guidelines, writing unit tests, reviewing each other's code, and ultimately learning to be better software developers.

## Goals

1. Guide potential contributors on version control, unit testing, and algorithms.
1. Add at least one algorithm every week.
